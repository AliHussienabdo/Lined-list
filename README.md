    <h3>introduction.</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>that was project i did as a practice on building some of </h4>
        <h4>the most Famous data structure Like Linked-list & Stack & queue</h4>
        <h4>and some algoritms Like sorting and searching in a linked list</h4>
        <h4>it's a full implemention to the linked list and totally reliable for usage</h4>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h3>sub-projects.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lined-list</li>
        <li>Stack</li>
        <li>queue</li>
        <li>inedx linked list</li>
        <li>infix to postfix => that evaluate the Mathimatical expressions.</li>
        <li>sorting algoritms </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Object-oreinted-programming.</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>i have apply OOP-principels in that project</h4>
        <h4>so I implement Stack & queue using inheritance and composition</h4>        
    </ul>

<div>
    <h3>Evaluate Mathimatical expressions.</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>I start this project just to build linked-list</h4>
        <h4>But i extend it building Stack and Queue using My Linked list</h4>
        <h4>and ah4h4ly some algorithms for searching and sorting that Linked List</h4>
        <h4>i also implement a class that extend the stack </h4>
        <h4>to Exaluate the Mathimatical exh4ressions using stack DS </h4>
    </ul>

    <h3>Indexed_Linked_List.</h3>
    <ul>
        <h3>indexed linked list is a good ah4h4lication of linked list that</h3>
        <h3>try to find a solution for searching in Linked list.</h3>
        <h3>the basic idea is to build an array of 26 cells, like a mah4</h3>
        <h3>we ah4h4end a value by chicking the first charachter and but it in it's index</h3>
        <h3>so if we want to seach for a Name like (ali) we search in the first cell</h3>
        <h3>so it decrease the time of searching.</h3>
    </ul>
